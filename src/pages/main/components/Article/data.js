    text: `1. Don’t drink sugar calories Sugary drinks are among the most fattening items you can put into your body.
    
This is because your brain doesn’t measure calories from liquid sugar the same way it does for solid food (1Trusted Source).
      
Therefore, when you drink soda, you end up eating more total calories (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).

Sugary drinks are strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems (4Trusted
Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source). 

Keep in mind that certain fruit juices may be almost as bad as soda in this regard, as they sometimes contain just as much sugar.
Their small amounts of antioxidants do not negate the sugar’s harmful effects (8Trusted Source). 

2. Eat nuts Despite being high in fat, nuts are incredibly nutritious and healthy.
 
They’re loaded with magnesium, vitamin E, fiber, and various other nutrients (9Trusted Source). 

Studies demonstrate that nuts can help you lose weight and may help fight type 2 diabetes and heart 
disease (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).`,

    text: `Additionally, your body doesn’t absorb 10–15% of the calories in nuts. Some evidence also suggests that this food can boost metabolism (13Trusted Source).

In one study, almonds were shown to increase weight loss by 62%, compared with complex carbs (14Trusted Source).

3. Avoid processed junk food (eat real food instead) Processed junk food is incredibly unhealthy.

These foods have been engineered to trigger your pleasure centers, so they trick your brain into overeating — even promoting food addiction in some people (15Trusted Source). 

They’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients but high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugar and refined grains. 
Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.

4. Don’t fear coffee Coffee is very healthy.

It’s high in antioxidants, and studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses
(16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source). 

5. Eat fatty fish Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat. 

This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and 
various other nutrients (22Trusted Source). Studies show that people who eat the most fish have a lower risk of several conditions, including 
heart disease, dementia, and depression (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25). 

6. Get enough sleep The importance of getting enough quality 
sleep cannot be overstated. 

Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental
performance (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).`,
